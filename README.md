# README.md 
This is a course work for R Data Cleaning  class
## Files in repository
Repo has following files (except this one):
* CodeBook.md - description of the data
* RunAnalysis.R - script:  it reads data, organizes proper data frames, and calculates requested summarizations (res2 for what step 2 of instructions asked, and res5 for the step 5).
It assumes data in the main directory, in  the same tree structure as the dataset has been published.
Real data processing (say, machine learning training and validation) can be called from the denoted place in this script.
